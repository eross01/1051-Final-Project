# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project will likely be "Dramartsy: Photographic masterpieces through a dramatic, artistic lense."

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be the website of a fake photography company where a user can interact with the business's offerings and view their merchandise.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

  The main goal of my software will be to create an interactive website experience that mimics that of an actual, professional business. The resulting project will have many of the features, both dealing with aestheics and functionality, that one would expect on a companies website, including an eye-catching home page that draws people in and encourages them to continue on looking at the sight, a user-friendly interface (where it is clear how to move from one area of the site to another), and an "About the Company" page that explains the origins behind the idea for the business. Specifc to the photogratic-focus of the page, the completed project will feature a gallery page (separated into different categories based on the pictures) where the art can be showcased in an accessible fashion. Time allowing, this gallery will be extended into a shopping page, where customers will be able to add "products" and pictures to their shopping cart, checking out once they are satisfied with their selection. Furthermore, if there is time, my software will allow users to make an account and sign up for fake classes on photographic techniques through the website. There will be links throughout the webpages to bring the user to other locations on the site that are in line with their interest, as well as drop down menus in order to group similar links together and avoid unnecessary button cluttering.
  In order to execute this project, I will be using Visual Studio Code for the bulk of my programming and file storage and Git Hub as my backup location, so, in the event of unforeseen circumstances, none of my work is lost. Also, I will be utilizing at least Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge in order to test my software, as I want to ensure that my software runs smoothly in a variety of browsers and that I catch when some features are able to be implemented in some browsers but not others (such as how Google Chrome does not allow music to be auto-played on a webpage, but Microsoft Edge does allow this). I assume that by the end of this project, I will have used used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask, as well as SQL if I choose to implement features that require communication with a database and the BootStrap CSS framework in order to utilize premade, attractive website elements.
  
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not combining this project with the project of another class.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am working alone.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project would be to have a fully functioning website, complete with a homepage, about the company page, a gallery of photographs organized based on certain criteria, and a search system for customers to search for a given photograph based on their interest.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my final project, and features I think I will have time to add before the project's deadline, is an additional page where user's can register for fake classes or workshops hosted by the company (this could possibly involve an acount-making system being implemented into the websites structure) and extra aesthetic features, such as the possible integration of rotating pictures in order to make the page more visually interesting.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my final project would to also have time to add a "store" page on the website, where customers would have a set amount of money (or perhaps be able to earn money through a clicker-game system) in order to buy merchandise, as well as adding additional interactive features where a user could upload their own photo and add filters to it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

  My first step torwards the completion of this project will be to finish the Web Track of CS50 so that I am familiar with Flask and SQL, allowing me to incorporate these elements into my website as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Next, I will begin to plan out each feature I would like to add to my website project, creating a timeline to ensure that the features I want to have completed by the assignment's deadline are functional and opening up the path for me to include additional elements I am hoping to add to the website, time allowing. Under this plan, my current intention is to start work on the websites homepage once I finish watching the track videos. There are multiple topics that I will need to research into or learn more about as I go through this project. For instance, I need to look into all of the features BootStrap has made available so that I do not need to waste time creating something that has already been made and throughly tested. Hopefully, by taking the time to do this research, I will be able to create the design and structure of my website. Next, I will need to do research into technqiues well established websites use in order to make their pages engaging, pleasing to look at, and organized. This will involve browsing websites from a variety of different organizations (from large companies like target, to museums such as the Philadelphia Art Museum) and taking note of structural, as well as design, elements they utilized in the creation of their respective webpages. Overall, however, the majority of research time will be devoted to discovering the features available in HTML, as while building the page for my "Homepage" assignment, I discovered I was only scratching the surface in all of the structural elements available to web developers.
