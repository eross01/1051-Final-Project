# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project will likely be "Dramartsy: Photographic masterpieces through a dramatic, artistic lense."

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be the website of a fake photography company where a user can interact with the business's offerings and view their merchandise.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The main goal of my software will be to create an interactive website experience that mimics that of an actual, professional business. The resulting project will have many of the features, both dealing with aestheics and functionality, that one would expect on a companies website, including an eye-catching home page that draws people in and encourages them to continue on looking at the sight, a user-friendly interface (where it is clear how to move from one area of the site to another), and an "About the Company" page that explains the origins behind the idea for the business. Specifc to the photogratic-focus of the page, the completed project will feature a gallery page (separated into different categories based on the pictures) where the art can be showcased in an accessible fashion. Time allowing, this gallery will be extended into a shopping page, where customers will be able to add "products" and pictures to their shopping cart, checking out once they are satisfied with their selection. Furthermore, if there is time, my software will allow users to make an account and sign up for fake classes on photographic techniques through the website. There will be links throughout the webpages to bring the user to other locations on the site that are in line with their interest, as well as drop down menus in order to group similar links together and avoid unnecessary button cluttering.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not combining this project with the project of another class.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am working alone.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project would be to have a fully functioning website, complete with a homepage, about the company page, a gallery of photographs organized based on certain criteria, and a search system for customers to search for a given photograph based on their interest.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my final project, and features I think I will have time to add before the project's deadline, is an additional page where user's can register for fake classes or workshops hosted by the company (this could possibly involve an acount-making system being implemented into the websites structure) and extra aesthetic features, such as the possible integration of rotating pictures in order to make the page more visually interesting.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my final project would to also have time to add a "store" page on the website, where customers would have a set amount of money (or perhaps be able to earn money through a clicker-game system) in order to buy merchandise, as well as adding additional interactive features where a user could upload their own photo and add filters to it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step torwards the completion of this project will be to finish the Web Track so that I am familiar with Flask and SQL, allowing me to incorporate these elements into my website as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
