# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to learn and become comfortable with HTTP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I am planning on completing a website project. Some general ideas for this project I have are an online registration system for classes, a website to showcase photographs with fake buying capabilities, 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am planning to work alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
