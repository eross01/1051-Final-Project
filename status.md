#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

One of the largest problems I have encountered so far is that Windows does not recognize Apple's .HEIC file format for pictures which meant that for each picture I had to individually go into the photo editer built into the computer and save a copy as a .jpg. Although this was not difficult, it was time consuming, as the process to me over an hour to copy about 90 photos.
